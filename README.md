# js-boilerplate-nahid

Boilerplate to automate standard good practice stuff across js projects.

* esdoc
* eslint
* js-beautify
* mocha
* istanbul.js

with my preferred settings.

Run

   jbn init

to get started or not. Initialisation is optional. Look at what's available
with jbn -h

As always, save/back up your work before trying any shady tools. My practice
and preferences aren't always conventional. And despite my claim, I am probably
not omniscient either. There is a very good chance you may not like or
comprehend the results.
